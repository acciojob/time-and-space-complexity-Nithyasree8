	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure used to describe the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input. It is crucial to analyze time complexity to ensure that an algorithm is efficient, meaning it performs well even as the size of the input grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. This can be expressed with notations such as O(n), which indicates how the memory usage scales with the input size. Understanding space complexity helps in optimizing algorithms to use less memory.</p>
